# Expo Upgrade Checkpoints

This is the resumable execution record for `MVP-PRE-001`. The strategy and gate
definitions remain in [mvp-platform-baseline.md](mvp-platform-baseline.md).

## SDK 55

Status: automated gate passed on branch `upgrade-expo-55` on 2026-09-20.

### Installed baseline

- Expo `55.0.31`
- React Native `0.83.10`
- React and React Test Renderer `19.2.0`
- Reanimated `4.2.1`, Worklets `0.7.4`, Gesture Handler `2.30.1`
- Gradle `9.0.0`

`expo-file-system` and `babel-preset-expo` are now explicit dependencies because
application and test code imported them while SDK 54 supplied them only transitively.

### Compatibility changes

- Lowercased the invalid app scheme from `LiftingLog` to `liftinglog`.
- Removed obsolete `newArchEnabled` and `android.edgeToEdgeEnabled` app fields.
- Regenerated the checked-in Android project with a clean SDK 55 prebuild.
- Declared `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` in app configuration so clean prebuilds retain it.
- Preserved the custom rest-timer package registration, receivers, Kotlin sources,
  layouts, notification icon, and exact-alarm permission.
- Updated the Expo Camera orientation patch for the SDK 55 source shape.
- Hardened the CSS interop patch to verify that upstream uses
  `react-native-safe-area-context` when no mutation is required.
- Updated the analytics deck scroll ref type for the React Native 0.83 definitions.

### Gate results

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm ls --depth=0` | Pass |
| `npm run lint -- --no-cache` | Pass; 20 baseline warnings, 0 errors |
| `npm run typecheck` | Pass |
| `npm test -- --runInBand` | Pass; 26 suites, 337 tests |
| `npx expo config --type public` | Pass; SDK 55 and lowercase scheme confirmed |
| `npx expo-doctor@latest` | 19/20 checks pass |
| `android\\gradlew.bat :app:compileDebugKotlin` | Pass |
| `git diff --check` | Pass |

The remaining Expo Doctor finding is the expected warning that app configuration is
not automatically synchronized when a native directory is checked in. This branch
ran and reviewed a clean Android prebuild, so the warning is documented rather than
suppressed.

### Deferred checks and risks

- Android/iOS development-build and real-device scenarios remain part of the final
  SDK 57 gate; this checkpoint proves compilation, not runtime device behavior.
- `npm audit --omit=dev` reports 27 production-tree advisories (1 critical, 8 high,
  16 moderate, 2 low). Do not run `npm audit fix --force`: suggested changes include
  incompatible Expo package downgrades. Address compatible transitive updates and the
  direct `drizzle-orm` advisory in `MVP-PRE-001E` with database regression coverage.
- Native dependency deprecation warnings remain, notably in Linear Gradient, Pager
  View, WebView, Screens, and the custom rest-timer package. They do not fail the SDK
  55 build and must be reassessed at SDK 57.

## Resume Point

1. Confirm `upgrade-expo-55` is committed and integrated into `main` after review.
2. Branch `upgrade-expo-56` from that exact integrated commit.
3. Upgrade only to the latest stable SDK 56 patch and run the same automated gate.
4. Do not start MVP feature branches until SDK 57, dependency review, native patch
   review, and final development-build checks are complete.

The pre-existing `.gitignore` modification and
`docs/codebase-analysis-2026-06-21/` directory are unrelated and excluded from these
upgrade commits.
